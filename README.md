Implementations of Deep Learning through-

1. Tic Tac Toe game played between an agent which used random strategy and another which uses Q-learning strategy
2. BERT Model for sentiment analysis of Google Play Store Reviews (with 87% accuracy)
3. Neural Network Classifier for Musical Instrument Classification (e.g. trumpet, violin, piano) with 99% accuracy
4. Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) for generating fake images of clothing(that look real) on Fashion MNIST data
